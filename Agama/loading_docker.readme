To load the docker environment that is used for AGAMA
you have to run the container called "interesting_noether".

Once the container is working in an interactive terminal
you have to run:

jupyter notebook --ip=0.0.0.0 --no-browser --allow-root --NotebookApp.token=''

This will start the jupyter kernel at 127.0.0.1 withouth an auth token,
which allows VSCode to connect to the kernel and run the scripts.
