# Gaia DR3 HEALPix Query Function

## Description

The `query` function retrieves Gaia DR3 data for a specific region of the sky based on a provided HEALPix pixel. Using the nested HEALPix scheme, it extracts astrometric, photometric, and external geometrical distance data. The function is designed to return this data as a pandas DataFrame, with options to log into the Gaia archive for querying larger datasets.

## Features
- Supports queries based on HEALPix pixels using the nested format.
- Retrieves astrometric data such as proper motions, parallaxes, and their errors.
- Fetches photometric data like magnitudes and fluxes from Gaia DR3.
- Optionally retrieves external geometrical distances from the `gaiaedr3_distance` catalog.
- Merges the astrometric and external distance data for seamless analysis.
- Includes filters for astrometric quality using `ruwe < 1.4` for high-quality results.

## Installation

This script requires the following libraries:
- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [astropy](https://www.astropy.org/)
- [healpy](https://healpy.readthedocs.io/)
- [astroquery](https://astroquery.readthedocs.io/)

You can install them using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas astropy healpy astroquery
```

## Usage

To use the `query` function, call it with the appropriate HEALPix pixel and desired settings.

### Function Signature
```python
def query(HEALPix_pixel, nside=4, login=False, username='', password='', nested=True):
```

### Parameters:
- **HEALPix_pixel** (*int*):  
  The HEALPix pixel in nested format representing the sky region to query.
  
- **nside** (*int*, default=4):  
  The HEALPix resolution, where higher values of `nside` provide finer sky divisions. Default is 4.
  
- **login** (*bool*, default=False):  
  Set to `True` to log into the Gaia archive. You must provide a valid username and password.
  
- **username** (*str*, default=''):  
  Your Gaia archive username, used when `login=True`.
  
- **password** (*str*, default=''):  
  Your Gaia archive password, used when `login=True`.
  
- **nested** (*bool*, default=True):  
  Indicates if the HEALPix pixel is in nested format. If set to `False`, the pixel index will be converted from ring to nested.

### Returns:
- **pandas.DataFrame**:  
  A DataFrame containing the astrometric, photometric, and geometrical distance data for the queried HEALPix pixel.

## Workflow

1. **HEALPix Pixel Processing**  
   The function handles converting ring-format pixels to nested format if necessary.

2. **Source ID Range Calculation**  
   Based on the HEALPix pixel and `nside`, the function calculates the `source_id_range` to query the correct data from the Gaia DR3 catalog.

3. **Gaia Archive Login**  
   If `login=True`, the function logs into the Gaia archive using the provided credentials and ensures the number of active jobs does not exceed the allowed limit.

4. **Data Query from Gaia DR3**  
   The function retrieves astrometric and photometric data, such as positions, parallax, and magnitudes, from the `gaiadr3.gaia_source` table.

5. **External Distance Query**  
   It then queries the external `gaiaedr3_distance` catalog for geometrical distance estimates, including uncertainties.

6. **Merging Results**  
   The astrometric and geometrical distance data are merged into a single DataFrame based on the `source_id`.

7. **Performance Logging**  
   The function prints the total query time to monitor performance.

## Example Usage

Here’s an example of how to use the function:

```python
# Import required libraries and the query function
from my_module import query

# Perform a query for a specific HEALPix pixel
result_df = query(
    HEALPix_pixel=1234, 
    nside=4, 
    login=True, 
    username='your_username', 
    password='your_password'
)

# Display the first few rows of the DataFrame
print(result_df.head())
```

## Notes
- The function filters data based on `ruwe < 1.4` to ensure high-quality astrometric results.
- A section of the code (commented out) provides optional parallax zero-point correction, which can be applied if needed.
- If the user has more than five active jobs on the Gaia archive, the function will automatically remove excess jobs to prevent exceeding the limit.
