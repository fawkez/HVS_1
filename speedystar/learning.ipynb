    "\n",
    "`speedystar` is a python package which will allow you to generate, evolve, propagate and perform mock observations of single stars ejected at high velocities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure this notebook is in the parent directory of `speedystar/`. The package itself is not large, but performing mock observations requires downloading a Milky Way dust map which by default is ~500 MB. This free space is assumed to be in the current working directory by default, but does not have to be (see below).\n",
    "\n",
    "We currently do not recommend installing `speedystar` globally using pip since that prevents you from editing the source code directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "`speedystar` uses a number of Python packages. Some of these which might not already be included in your Python distribution are astropy, galpy, mwdust and pygaia. Simply run this notebook and conda or pip install any package that doesn't exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "More accurate treatments of the Gaia selection functions and astrometric spread function also require the Python packages scanninglaw and gaiaunlimited. These packages currently do not support Windows since they rely on the healpy package, but can be installed using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "help(speedystar.starsample) will display the names and descriptions of every method in `speedystar`, as well as descriptions of common column names.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "`speedystar` outputs are .fits tables containing useful info for each mock star as well as metadata describing the assumptions that go into the sample. They can be accessed using astropy.table or with [Topcat](https://www.star.bris.ac.uk/~mbt/topcat/) or however else you'd like to read them.\n"

    "The 'typical' way to eject hypervelocity stars is via the Hills Mechanism, in which a stellar binary approaches Sgr A* on a very low-angular momentum orbit. At a particular distance from Sgr A*, the tidal forces across the binary surpass the gravitational binding energy of the binary itself and the binary is separated. One star is captured in orbit around Sgr A* and the other is flung away at a velocities up to several thousand km/s. Stars ejected above the escape velocity of the Galaxy are hypervelocity stars (HVSs) -- they will eventually escape the Galaxy entirely. Note that there will also be a population of stars ejected slowly as well, which will not escape the inner Galaxy and might survive to interact again with Sgr A*.\n",

    "With `speedystar` you first generate a sample of stars at the moment of ejection. The number of stars and their masses/metallicities/velocities/flight times/evolutionary stages depend a lot on assumptions you make about stars and binaries in the Galactic Centre, see [Evans+2022](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.512.2350E/abstract) for more details.\n"
